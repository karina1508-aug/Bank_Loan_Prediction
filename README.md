# Bank_Loan_Prediction
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or not. The objective is to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions by analyzing applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and other relevant factors.
